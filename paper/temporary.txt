Following the “rapid-prototyping for business” methodology that we have stuck to,
during this project, we are again going to use a pre-made solution by Petter Kraabol
 which he creatively dubbed: “Twitch-Chat-Downloader”.  
This command-line tool allows us to download the complete chat-history from a twitch
 VOD (Video-On-Demand), using either preset or custom formats.  We are largely only
  interested in the exact time each comment was posted, and not the duration of which 
  it stayed in the chat, and thus we are going to use the built-in format “irc”, which 
  might be familiar to a few of you. 
Visually, it looks like this:  [timestamp] <username> comment.
This format is rather simple, but it gives us all the information we need,
and as for the implementation, we used Python's subprocess library to use
the tools CLI, and converted that to a python function..
