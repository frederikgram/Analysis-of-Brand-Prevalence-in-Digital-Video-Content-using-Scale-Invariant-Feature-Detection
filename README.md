This project is meant to be a prototype for how more interesting analytics can be extracted and calculated from videos in an easily-appliable way.

# Design
The project is designed with microservices and containerization in mind from the get-go. Using REST architecture to allow for both inter-process communication as well as interacting with the service from external tools.

Ignoring the terrible naming, this project allows advertisers to _automatically_ gain valuable insight about their advertisements on online streaming platforms such as twitch.

This is done by analysing both the actual screen time of the advertisements (using SIFT) and the percentage of the advertisement being show (meaning obstructing elements is considered)

Furthermore, this project gives statistics on both user interaction and viewcounts, which is used to predict how much attention the users had during the time of advertisements was being shown.
